    <h3> Book Summary </h3>
    <br>
<p>

In 7 Secrets Of Shiva,<b> Pattanaik </b>begins his analysis of<b> Hindu mythology</b> by looking at the conflict between Western methodology and Hindu devotees. He states that when Western scholars and academicians examine Hindu mythological symbols such as the <b>Shiva Linga</b>, they are more concerned about the objective representation. Objectively it is a phallus, but subjectively it represents <b>a mind that is unstirred and happy</b>. Hindu devotees are more concerned with the latter explanation and therefore ignore the former during their worship.Shiva, ‘the destroyer’ among the Hindu trinity (of gods), is
depicted in many contradictory manners. He is an ascetic
who wears animal skin, his body smeared with ashes.
Contradictory to his wild nature, he is also depicted as
having a family, with a beautiful wife and two children.With the Kedarnath tragedy, Shiva has once again crash-landed in our psyche. But then, he has always fascinated us, provoking our imagination like no other.

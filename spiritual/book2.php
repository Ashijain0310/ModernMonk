    <h3> Book Summary </h3>
    <br>
<p>
<b>‘I Have A Dream’</b> is the story of <b>20 idealists</b> who think and act like entrepreneurs. They are committed to different causes, but they have one thing in common: a belief that principles of management can and must be used to achieve a greater common good.

These stories say one thing loud and clear change starts with one person, and that person could be<b> someone next door</b>. Someone like you.
For a generation thriving on relentless pursuit of selfish goals, Rashmi Bansal’s “I have a Dream” comes as a reminder that life is much more than just one’s own world. The book chronicles the lives of twenty people, who took a step towards bringing happiness in the lives of millions, but not in the usual charitable ways. They took the ideals of a business complete with profit motive and turned them into tools of betterment of the society. They are all, what can be termed as <b>‘social entrepreneurs’</b>.

    <h3> Book Summary </h3>
    <br>
<p>
The book <b>"If truth be told"</b> was so enchanting that I binge read the book in 5 hours only taking a break in between to prepare and eat lunch. At many places it reminded me of the <b>Autobiography of Yogi</b>. 
The story is basically about a man who was destined to be <b>become a monk even before his birth.</b> 
<b>Om Swami</b> grew up in a loving family where his mom was a god loving lady. In their house, they bonded and disciplined kids with love and not admonition. He was an intelligent kid who read books voraciously and started earning money through astrology and invested in stocks.

<p>
<b>The Leader Who Had No Title</b> is the story of a <b>young army veteran</b>, returned to society and struggling to find meaning in his work and in his life.  Enter <b>Tommy Flinn</b>, an eccentric character who, over the course of a day, introduces our young hero to four unique individuals.  The mentor collective breathe life back into the vet as they <b>illuminate the path to meaningful work</b> and with it, a sense of purpose to life in general.
I think that last bit is the part that made this book so powerful for me.  I picked it up as a book on leadership and yet while it definitely provides tools and attitude shifts that will lead to better leadership in the workplace, the lessons in this book are about taking ownership of your life.  About not playing the victim.

    <br>
<p>
<b>Napoleon Hill,</b> then a young special investigator for a nationally known business magazine, was sent to interview Andrew Carnegie. During that interview, Carnegie slyly dropped a hint of a certain master power he used—a magic law of the human mind, <b>a little-known psychological principle</b>—that was amazing in its power.
That part of the interview never made it into Hill’s magazine, but it did launch the young author on a research journey that lasted twenty years. <b>Think and Grow Rich</b> is the result of Hill’s study of over <b>five hundred self-made millionaires</b>—a condensed, accessible explanation of his Law of Success philosophy, which includes thirteen steps to riches (financial, emotional, and spiritual).
